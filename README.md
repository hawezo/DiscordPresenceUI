# DiscordPresenceUI

Little software made in C# with the help of [Modern UI](https://github.com/firstfloorsoftware/mui) and [discord-rpc-csharp](https://github.com/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp). It will start with Windows in the system tray if you configure it to do so, so it doesn't annoy you and your presence will always be displayed.
Be aware that if you play a game, it will override the presence, but as soon as you stop playing, it will display again.

In order to make it work, you will need to configure an app on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). More informations in the `help` tab.
